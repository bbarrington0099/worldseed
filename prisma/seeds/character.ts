She was raised for a time by a band of druids until a fateful encounter with a wild beast forced her into a cavern where she discovered an ancient standing stone marked with draconic runes. Touching it bound draconic power to her forever, awakening her bond with a drake. For years she survived in the forests alone, guided by both Fey whispers and her newfound draconic strength, until she finally gathered the courage to journey into cities. There she lived as a ranger, selling her skills and slowly making her way across the land. Eventually, Fiona joined the Huntbound Order, where her knowledge of beasts and survival proved invaluable on countless quests. During her time adventuring, she fell in love with the guild's groundskeeper Ilikan, and after marrying and giving birth to their son, she chose to retire from the dangerous life of quests. For the past nine years, Fiona has served as the Huntbound Order's seeded Beast Master, tending to the guild's mounts, companions, and familiars.

There he crossed paths with Tharos, the Guild Master of the Huntbound Order, who took a keen interest in this unusual shifter with a giant's upbringing. At the time, the guild was expanding and in need of a new hall, and Tharos offered Ilikan the position of groundskeeper. Ilikan accepted, and over the years became a cornerstone of the guild's daily life. Alongside tending to the land, halls, and gardens, Ilikan earned renown within the guild as a skilled mender — sewing garments, repairing armor, and fixing tools with the same care he applies to nurturing the grounds. During his service, he met and married Fiona Mirage, the guild's Beast Master, and together they now raise their son within the safety of the guild hall.

When his caravan was threatened by raiders, Keoti joined the defenders despite his age, using his speed and cunning to distract and mislead attackers until reinforcements arrived. The memory of standing with his people, protecting something greater than himself, never left him. Years later, when Kuriguer began pressing into the coastal cities and forests, Keoti entered the Skratonian Alliance's ranks as a scout. His natural swiftness made him ideal for reconnaissance, though he broke tradition by wielding a greataxe, learning to channel his momentum into devastating strikes while still clad in light armor. The horrors of battle scarred him, but also deepened his conviction: the strength of the many rests on the sacrifice and duty of the few. It was this belief that led him to swear the Oath of the Crown, devoting himself to law, order, and the protection of those who could not protect themselves. During long campaigns, he began to experience moonlit dreams and visions, which chaplains of Sehanine Moonbow taught him to embrace as guidance. Her teachings balanced his rigid sense of duty with hope, mystery, and the promise of renewal. After the war, Keoti was recommended by a fellow veteran to Tharos, the Huntbound Order's Guild Master who was seeking someone who could handle conflict beyond monster slaying, Tharos welcomed Keoti as the guild's House Carl. Today, Keoti serves as both protector and peacekeeper, his commanding presence enough to quell most disputes, though when force is required, a quick resolution can still be expected.",

Beneath his stern and laconic exterior lies a surprising depth shaped by his devotion to Sehanine Moonbow. In quiet moments, Keoti speaks of journeys as dreams given form, and sees every path as part of a greater mystery.

In truth, Snek had only been repeating overheard conversations — as he often did — and never understood the importance of what he had let slip. Though innocent of intentional betrayal, the damage was done, and his clan cast him out as a traitor. Lost and alone, he wandered the forests for months until he was taken in by a wandering Circle of the Moon druid grove. Though he never fully mastered their ways, he discovered a natural gift for conversing with animals and soon became the forest's greatest gossip, gathering news from creatures near and far. One day he strayed too far and became lost in a city, where fate led him to the Huntbound Order. Though adventuring life quickly proved... not good for his health, Snek found his place caring for the guild's messenger network of birds, beasts, and magical couriers. Over time, he became the guild's seeded Fancier and Messenger, always armed with the latest tidbit of information (most of which he assumes comes from his animals' chatter). While some suspect he unknowingly runs a spy network, Snek himself is blissfully unaware, simply happy to have a home and a purpose.",

            backstory: "Xandros Kirvath has spent his entire life in the lands of Skratonia, Born to a long line of proud Kalashtar, Xandros was always aware of the spiritual bond that tied him to his Quori companion, a Hashalaq spirit of wisdom, judgement, and foresight. His connection to this being, named Ishara, runs deep. Their conversations are not just spiritual exchanges but tactical deliberations, for Ishara’s insights into the dreams of the world often shape Xandros’s actions in the waking world.\nXandros's early life was one of seclusion and contemplation, where the whispers of Ishara guided him. The quiet communion of their shared dreams often brought him vivid and disturbing visions—dreams of monsters ravaging the land, cities burning, and innocents suffering under monsters. These visions fueled his desire to protect, but also to understand. While his kin often found solace in peaceful meditations and intellectual pursuits, Xandros felt a growing restlessness. The horrors he witnessed in his sleep seemed to bleed into the real world, pushing him towards action.\nHaving grown up amongst elves Xandros became a devout cleric of Labelas Enoreth, the elven god of time and longevity, Xandros sought not only to heal but to prevent the ravages of time’s unchecked progression. He is happy to discuss topics around Labelas and will often be found trying to recruit new disciples from those that are willing to listen. \nHe saw his role not only as a protector but as a tactician, seeking ways to anticipate the future and safeguard the realms from the terrors that haunted the dreams of others. Labelas’s teachings spoke to him of the value of foresight, planning, and the careful management of time a philosophy that resonated deeply with his strategic mindset.\nXandros is very friendly and can be quite talkative during the day to day. But while on a mission and especially during combat Xandros will get very quiet only speaking when giving direction or communicating with Ishara.\nThree years ago, driven by the recurring dreams of catastrophe, Xandros joined The Huntbound Order, a guild dedicated to eradicating monsters and dark forces that threatened the natural order. Though his quiet and cautious demeanor often puts him at odds with the more direct members of the order, his meticulous planning and foresight have made him an invaluable asset on missions. He consults Ishara often, speaking aloud as though the spirit were present, carefully weighing each option before acting. Individuals unfamiliar with Kalashtar often think he is crazy talking to himself.\nXandros’s work with The Huntbound Order has been a grueling but necessary trial. Every mission, every hunt, is a step toward eradicating the evils he believes are growing in the world. With each battle won, Xandros finds himself more determined to fulfill his purpose: to confront the nightmares that plague his dreams and safeguard the future.\nWhile Xandros does everything he can to keep his emotions in check, when overwhelmed by the emotions of those around him or from himself, Xandros’s eyes will light in solid colors depending on the emotion(s) that he is currently feeling emanating solid light from them. There have been a few times when a situation has become so dire that Xandros almost lost control of his emotion letting forth great power amplifying his abilities.\nXandros will do whatever is necessary to protect his friends and those Ishara and him deem innocent.",

            backstory: "Born into the Frostmarch Company, a clan of hobgoblins nestled in the frozen wastes of Bulsania, making their living as mercenaries, and monster hunters. Krak was a portly child, despite his size he still struggled to adapt to the cold, layering extra compared to the strong willed kin around him. He never knew who in the clan was his actual blood, his true parents, the clan just raises you as one of many. Build yourself up so you can be of proper service in this wasteland, for it was war to simply live. He found comfort in his two brothers however, the older Zrar and the Sabaak.\nAfter being of age you are permitted to go on your first hunt with a group, mine was one of the small Rimebeasts of the waste, not to be any less underestimated. Was never a good shot with a crossbow, just grazed it, enough to charge me and give me a nasty wound on my side, but not smart enough to see the trident embedded in the snow.\nAfter years Zrar took me on a scouting mission to the far northern spires, some target was supposed to be out there but we never found it, never even saw traces of life. We started heading back when noticing a blizzard, eerily close, silent, and certainly wasn't there before. It moved slowly, swirling the harsh winds, snow and ice shards, but rather than a single direction, it moved closer to that of a stumbling drunk wobbling towards the closest sound before engulfing it. We immediately ran, cracking the ice and snow below us, and like a hound that just saw the rabbit running, the blizzard began hunting us, moving faster and faster, no longer silent as the winds made similar sounds to the torturer's hut. It was soul retching, and we were slower than it. Zrar pushed me into a crater, covering me with his thick Balckrak fur cloak and covering the top with snow. He knew something I didn't. Just my eyes peeked through as the snow covering turned to a thin layer of ice.\nWhat I saw that day, I see almost every single night, nightmares that will haunt me to this day. The blizzard has arms, limbs, faces but torn to shreds from the shards of ice within the blizzard, a hoard moving unnaturally, sporadically, and violently. Whatever it was didn't even care Zrar was attempting to attack it, all of them slowly surrounding him as the gale got stronger, all of the entities screaming in unison in pained shrieks.  His face getting cut to sheds just from standing, one came shambling beside him unnoticed, reached out and ripped his arm off, before dragging him deeper into the blizzard. It slowly continued its path, not acknowledging my terror, or pained cries.\nBreaking out of the ice felt easier than it should when it left. Grasping to his tear soaked cloak I stumbled over to his arm, his large pauldron indented and cut, his warrior spirit still holding onto his silver warhammer. Gathering everything I returned to camp, with a new hatred and taking up my older brother's items.\nOver time, I began seeing Zrar again, around corners, moments after waking up, in the periphery of my vision, I thought myself insane, but no it was him, taking time to operate before me. The first manifestation was while having a nightmare I was shunted awake from the sound of breaking glass, Zrar standing to the side astonished and looking at his hand. The first time he was able to manipulate the material realm in a successful attempt to wake me of nightmare. Confusion, wonder, happiness, sadness, no word truly fit the emotion upon seeing him again but this would not be the last. It seems Zrar’s spirit was not ready to move on, and either I, or his items were binding his soul to the materiam.\nEventually we were conducting a full raid, The Icemaw tribe sacked food caravans to the main city and was paying the company to completely wipe them out. By this point it wasn't the first time i’ve killed a humanoid, those points i was consumed with so much pain and hatred It never bothered me much, finding delivering them to death was a gift, no longer suffering in this wasteland, return to the spirits that haunt this land or go wherever their spirits go when they don't stay.\nWe came during the night, while they’re numb or huddled around their fires. The company took the lookouts without a sound before the war cries were too late to properly defend against. We each took to huts that seemed worthwhile, we followed the companies rules taught into us from day 1\nyou take the majority for the company.\nAny slain enemy is marked by their slayer, the slayer has priority over personal loot. If it is not taken it is to be stripped and thrown into the company pile.\nAnything of use must be taken\nLeave the bodies for the Rimebeasts or cold to take them.\nI noticed a thick covered tent layered with candles on the outside of the entrance, still lit even with the wind. Weird. I could hear the confused slaughtered wandering around. Not aware death has taken them already. I wished not to hear their wails and would rather take my chances",
